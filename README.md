# Box-it
This is a website created using only HTML5 and CSS. This website uses CSS flexbox.
This website is responsive.
Works well on phones.
Although, has some problems with the 13-inch Macbook and some other screens, I am still working on that.
This is a public repository so you can download the zip file and take a look at the project.
